<h1> Iteration 3 </h1>
For web/html/css/js implementation of Moodi app<br><br>

I expect to need some help writing and/or reviewing/editing copy for the specific pages. Not sure how much will be required, but (as on now) I'm thinking it's best to push thru getting as many of the pages set up and functional, then come back and polish design and word choice as needed. 


Any/all help appreciated -- not sure if i'm currently behind or ahead of where we need to be at the moment. No worries if you're not familiar with html/css/js/able to do any coding, drafting any language/slogans/etc or hand drawing new layouts/functionality to use as a guide would help. Please take a look at the file `TODO.txt` and add any necessary pages, tasks, etc that need to be implemented. I'll put what I think we've got ahead of us, please add/change any errors/omissions


<h2> Folder structure </h2>

I'd like to try and keep our main/production files in the main directories images/, scripts/, styles/, with pages being in the top directory ./  
Drafts/previous versions try to keep separate. 

<h2> File Naming </h2>

<ul>
<li>
All lowercase letters.
</li>
<li>
Use hyphens (-), not underscores (_)
</li>
<li>
If u create a separate stylesheet for a page, please keep it the same name as the html file. Makes things easier. Ex. color-wheel.html; color-wheel.css
</li>
</ul>

<h2> Previewing </h2>
If you download (clone) the files/directories to your harddrive, you should be able to open any html page in your browser and see what it will look like. Let me know your thoughts!
